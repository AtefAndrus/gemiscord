## Development Guidelines

### Feature Development Process

1. **Requirements**: Define clear requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Design**: Technical design document and API specifications
3. **Implementation**: TDD approach with test-first development
4. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and manual testing
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Review**: Code review and quality assurance
7. **Deployment**: Staged rollout with monitoring

### Quality Standards

- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 80%+ code coverage for all new features
- **Performance**: <5s response time for AI, <3s for commands
- **Documentation**: Update specs and guides for all changes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript strict mode compliance
- **Security**: Security review for all external integrations

### Development Environment

```bash
# Core development commands
bun install                  # Install dependencies
bun run dev                  # Development server with hot reload
bun test                     # Run full test suite
bun test --coverage          # Test coverage analysis
bun run typecheck           # TypeScript validation
bun run lint                 # Code quality checks

# Testing commands
bun test tests/unit          # Unit tests only
bun test tests/integration   # Integration tests only
bun test --watch            # Watch mode for TDD
bun test --bail             # Stop on first failure
```

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment

- **Hardware**: 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Software**: Bun 1.2.15+, VS Code with TypeScript support
